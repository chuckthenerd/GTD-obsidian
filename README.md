## Folder layout within this vault

Since Obsidian has some very powerful filename and tag searching - the number of folders in use can be minimal.  The following folders are optional, but what I consider to be the current best practice.  Adapt the folder structure to whatever works for your needs:

- Projects
- Areas
- Resources
- Archives
- Attachments
- Daily Notes
- Templates

Most of the folders resemble the P.A.R.A approach promoted by Tiago Forte.

_P.A.R.A._ stands for Projects — Areas — Resources — Archives, the four top-level categories that encompass many types of information you might encounter 

Miscellaneous screenshots, PDFs, and other binary files could be classified as Resources, but let's place them into the **Attachments** folder.

The concept of journalling or a bullet journal will be facilitated by the use of the **Daily Notes** folder.  The hotkey CTRL-U will jump to todays note which gets created in the Daily Notes area with a filename in the format of YYYY-MM-DD (this is known as ISO 8601 by data nerds and it is very useful)

The **Templates** folder ties in with quickly generating a useful skeleton for information that shares a common basic format (e.g. books have a title, author, ISBN number; a contact has a name, birthday, email address).  



Since this system can also act as an Zettelkasten / external trusted system / second brain - you may benefit from reading up on that concept

## Extending Obsidian with plugins

More details within [[Obsidian plugins]]

This system is currently closely tied to an Obsidian community plugins:
- Tasks
- Dataview
- Templates (core plugin)
- [ ] Add template or templater functionality mention here
- [ ] Day Planner
- [ ] Calendar

**Daily notes** are a core plugin which is included by default by Obsidian.  However, a vanilla install has the plugin disabled.
