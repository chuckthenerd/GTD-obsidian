## Getting more advanced

## Folder layout within this vault

Since Obsidian has some very powerful filename and tag searching - the number of folders in use can be minimal.  The following folders are optional, but what I consider to be the current best practice.  Adapt the folder structure to whatever works for your needs:

- Projects
- Areas
- Resources
- Archives
- Attachments
- Daily Notes
- Templates

Some of the folders resemble the P.A.R.A approach promoted by Tiago Forte.

_P.A.R.A._ stands for **Projects** — **Areas** — **Resources** — **Archives**, the four top-level categories that encompass many types of information you might encounter 

The **Attachments** folder is used for miscellaneous screenshots, PDFs, and other binary files.  Entries in this folder are not frequently revised.

The **Daily Notes** folder will retain entries similar to a diary or journal.  The hotkey __CTRL-U__ will jump to todays note within this folder with a filename in the format of YYYY-MM-DD (this is known as ISO 8601 by data nerds and it is very useful).

The **Templates** folder ties in with quickly employing a useful baseline form for information that shares traits (e.g. the person template has a field for: name, birthday, email address; the project template has a field for: project name, start date, due date, completion date ).
