the 5 steps of the workflow process:  slightly different wording but same concept
- collect, process, organize, plan, and do
- capture, clarify, organize, reflect, and engage

## 5 Step process:
1. Capture/Collect
	1. email, mail, calls, ideas, tasks, assignments, voicemail
	2. Write down everything you need to do.
2. Process/Clarify
	1. Break down each task into an actionable next step.
	2. actionable? = Y
		1. 2 minute rule - just do it now
		2. push to action list
		3. = N
			1. discard
			2. file:  reference folder or [[Someday-Maybe]]
3. Organize
	1. Move each of those actionable tasks onto a specific list: 
		1. Action: Things to do next, 
		2. Waiting For: Tasks or projects you’ve delegated or are waiting on other people for, 
		3. etc.
	2. Project -
	Multiple actions
	3. Time - 
		Calendar or tickler file
	1. Context
		1. list of groceries
		2. list of calls to make
		3. [[WaitingFor]] follow-up
4. Plan/Reflect/Review
	1. weekly review - see [[weekly review Template]]
	2. Set time aside to re-assess your priorities and update your lists weekly or daily.
5. Engage / Do
	1. Calendar indicates today's needed activity
	2. Action list used in combination with current context to batch things together
	3. Start working through your __Action list__ in order.

# Concept:  6 Horizons of focus
https://gettingthingsdone.com/2011/01/the-6-horizons-of-focus/

Ground under my feet: Calendar/next actions
- Horizon 1: Projects
- Horizon 2: Areas of focus and accountability
- Horizon 3: One to two-year goals and objectives
- Horizon 4: Three to five-year vision
- Horizon 5: Purpose and principles	


Here's what I use:

* Community - voting and community service etc.

* Living Environment - keeping things clean and maintained and buying things I need

* Finance - self explanatory

* Health - physical and mental health

* Hobbies - I have sub-horizons for me on this one like writing and programming

* GTD - I have a horizon of focus for GTD so I can try out new software and keep an eye on how well I'm doing with it.

* Relationships - family, spouse, kids, pets

* Work - current job

* Career - overarching career goals and projects like creating portfolio projects for my resume or looking for business opportunities
