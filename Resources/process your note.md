Since the thought, "Take over the world" is not a quick 2 minute task, or a simple one line task, it can be categorized as a Project.

Projects involve multiple tasks and can benefit from a template to serve as a starting point.

Let's apply a template.

In addition to using the "Open command palette" button, the same palette can be opened by pressing (Windows: Ctrl-P, Mac: TBD)

Open the command palette by whichever method you prefer and type "open template"

note: Observe the hotkey available to do this is Alt-E

Type "Proj" and press Enter.

Behold the power of templates!  Your empty note is now populated.

Let's populate our project with a couple tasks.  Not many, just enough to get a feel for the Obsidian.

Add the following after "1. What is it that needs to be done?"

Consider preceding each of the lines above with 1 Tab character.  This indents the items as belonging under the parent area.

You've now processed your thought into a "project".  Since projects are a recurring theme in GTD, there is a dedicated [[Projects]] page that pulls together any pages with the tag "project".  This Projects page is also available in the starred menu at top left.

note: Any file can be starred/unstarred to allow for quick reference under that area.

However, the items you just created could use a bit more work.

Next up we'll [[organize your note]]
