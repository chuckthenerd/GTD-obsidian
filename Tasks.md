## Work in progress

Jugglers know their limits.  The number of items that are actively up in the air at one time being worked on should not exceed your limits.  Back in 1918 the [Ivy Lee method](https://jamesclear.com/ivy-lee) was a key approach in productivity, and it limited the number of items on a to-do list to 6 prioritized entries.

In recent years, Kanban boards have increased in popularity.  One approach they also suggest is to limit the work in progress (wip).  This can be facilitated by denoting a task as having a tag of \#wip


``` tasks
not done
description includes #wip 
path does not include Template
path does not include Archive
```
