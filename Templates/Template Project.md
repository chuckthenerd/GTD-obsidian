What is it that needs to be done
What is needed in order to do it?
Where can we get what we need?
How can we tell if we're doing it right?


### Bonus question that can be swapped out for #1:

What's the most important thing that it doesn't do yet?

[1] What are the next two things to do? (Assign a task date) 
[2] What needs to be completed today? 
[3] What are the stumbling blocks moving forward? (often helps me to identify the next two things) 
[4] Who else do I need to get involved? 
[5] What needs to rest in prayer? I review each project on Sunday to make adjustments for the coming week.
